# cba_settings_userconfig

This addon forces certain addon settings for all players on the server. It is intended to be used with the [CBA Settings](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/wiki/CBA-Settings-System).

## Philosophy

Addon settings should only be forced if they are required for sessions to work properly. All other settings should be left to the players to configure themselves. This allows players to customize their experience while ensuring that essential features are always enabled.
